# Task :
To build a stopwatch web application, you can use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML is used to structure the elements of the application. By implementing functions for starting, pausing, and resetting the stopwatch, as well as tracking and displaying lap times, users can accurately measure and record time intervals. With these technologies and functionalities, you can create an interactive and user-friendly stopwatch web application.

# Learnings from the Project:

**HTML:**
1. Element separation for improved DOM manipulation.

**CSS:**
1. Utilizing `box-sizing` to include padding, margin, and border in height and width calculations.
2. Using `overflow: hidden` to prevent scrolling and `overflow` to clip container content.
3. Responsive design with `em`, `rem`, `vh`, `vw` units.
4. `flex-wrap` for responsive layout, `flex-column` for vertical alignment.
5. Media queries for max-width responsiveness.
6. Animations for dynamic content transitions.
7. **Additional Details:**
   - `box-sizing: border-box;` ensures that padding and border are included in the element's total width and height.
   - `overflow: hidden;` disables scrolling, and strategic use of `overflow` is employed to clip content.
   - Units like `em`, `rem`, `vh`, and `vw` are used for automatic responsiveness with width adjustments.
   - `flex-wrap` is applied for elements to stack vertically instead of overlapping.
   - Animations are used for smooth transitions, like animating the displayed time.
   - Media queries with `max-width` are used for responsiveness, setting maximum widths for layout adjustments.

**JavaScript:**
1. QuerySelector for accessing HTML elements using class and ID.
2. EventListener for constructing events, passing functions without parentheses.
3. **Functions:**
   - **Toggle Start:**
     - Determines whether to start or stop the stopwatch based on the current state (`isRunning`).
     - Calls the appropriate function accordingly.
   - **Start Stopwatch:**
     - Sets the `starttime` value.
     - Adjusts the start time if the stopwatch was paused (`pausetime` is not zero).
     - Calls the `updateStopWatchFunction` to display and animate the stopwatch.
   - **Pause Stopwatch:**
     - Sets `isRunning` to false.
     - Records the pause time (`pausetime`) as the current time minus the start time.
   - **Update Stopwatch:**
     - Calculates the elapsed time by subtracting the start time from the current time.
     - Calls the `formatTime` function to convert the elapsed time into hours, minutes, and seconds.
     - Calls the `displayTime` function to update the displayed time.
     - Initiates an animation for the displayed time.
   - **Format Time:**
     - Performs mathematical calculations to obtain hours, minutes, and seconds from the given time.
     - Ensures the formatted time values are limited to two digits.
     - Returns an object containing the formatted time values.
   - **Display Time:**
     - Updates the HTML content for hours, minutes, and seconds with the values received in the object parameter.
   - **Resume Watch:**
     - Sets `isRunning` to true.
     - Adjusts `starttime` based on the original start time and any pause time.
     - Resets `pausetime` to zero.
     - Calls the `updateStopWatchFunction` to display and animate the resumed stopwatch.
   - **Reset Stopwatch:**
     - Resets the stopwatch to its initial state.
     - Sets `isRunning` to false, `pausetime` to zero.
     - Calls `clearLaps` to clear lap records.
     - Resets lap number to 1.
     - Updates the displayed time to zero.
   - **Clear Laps:**
     - Clears lap records by setting the `innerHTML` of the lap container to an empty string.
     - Resets the lap number to 1.
   - **Record Laps:**
     - Checks if the stopwatch is running before creating a lap record.
     - Calculates lap time using the `formatTime` function.
     - Creates a new div element using `createElement`.
     - Applies CSS styling to the div using `classList`.
     - Updates the `innerHTML` of the div with lap details using template literals.
     - Appends the div to the lap container using `appendChild`.

**General:**
1. Dynamic use of backticks and `${}` for string interpolation.
2. Consistent use of camelCase for function and variable names.
3. Careful handling of conditional operations based on `isRunning` state.
4. Strategic use of `createElement`, `classList`, and `appendChild` for dynamic content manipulation.
